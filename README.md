## Behaviour Driven Development

BDD focuses on how the user will interact with the application.

User experience:

1.See a landing page with several quotes on sticky notes.

2. Hover or focus on the note to remove the tilting effect; read effectively.<br>
    See: Quote, Author, Upvote and Downvote displayed.
3. Click on the **Upvote button** to up vote and **Downvote button** to down vote.<br> 
    This increments the value adjascent.<br>
    **NB** The quote with the most votes is highlighted in pink.
4. Click on See Details to display:
    - Submitted By - name of the person who uploaded the quote.
    - Delete button - Removes the Quote from display.
    - Elapsed time since the quote was added.

5. At the bottom is an add quote form.<br> 
    Enter your name, Quote and Author to create a new quote on submit.<br>
    The form throws errors below the inputs for empty values and cannot submit an empty form.
